# TATA-Forage-Simulation
In this simulation i was provided with **four tasks**. 
- The first task was mainly just a briefing on what IAM( Identity and Access Management- a framework of policies, processes, and technologies that enables organizations to manage digital identities and control user access to critical information and systems.) is, key concepts of IAM the role of IAM in cybersecurity and its importance in modern enterprises and a quiz.
- The Second task was the beginning of the Job simulation as i had to evaluate an enterprise's IAM strategy and considerations for implementing IAM in different organisational contexts. 
- The Third task was designing IAM solutions tailored to the enterprises' specific requirements
- The last task was to create a PowerPoint presentation that outlines the detailed implementation plan for enterprises IAM platform.

Before i get in to how i did this, id like to express that these resouces that you will get a glimpse of are provided by forage.

## Task two :

**Scope:**               
The project begins with a virtual meeting with your colleagues, Priya (IAM architect) and Ravi (IAM business analyst). Together, we are the experts entrusted with enhancing TechCorp Enterprises' cybersecurity.
The team's goal is to assess TechCorp's readiness for IAM implementation, just as you would in a genuine consulting engagement.

### Objective :
Assessing Techcorps readiness for an IAM solution.

I Was then provided with an email from Ravi with the details of TechCorps :
- Organisationals profile
- Challenges and Aspirations
- IAM strategy focus areas

Then i had to summarize this information and provide a checklist of the solution that i had in mind.
Below is a copy of the Email.

## Thinking process and steps taken :

A lot of this did not requirement much reasearch as i already had a good understanding of what IAM was and how to bring it in to a business environment, the first things i wanted to focus on was :

- **User Adoption and Training:**   
I wanted to make sure that during this process the business still had a level of efficiency and could still go about as it usually does. A well-designed IAM solution is only as effective as its adoption by users. Good role-based training will minimize confusion and reduce helpdesk tickets

- **Ease of Use and Efficiency:**  
Prioritizing ease of use, especially for daily tasks like logging in or requesting access is vital, failure can introduce new security risks.

- **Onboarding/Offboarding:**  
Automating user provisioning and de-provisioning based on HR systems will reduces manual effort, improve security and support agile business growth or contraction.

- **Industry Standard for International Reach:**   
With TechCorp's international presence, a unified IAM solution and consistent security policies across all regions will simplify management, reduce complexity for users who might work across borders, strengthen the overall security posture by eliminating fragmented access controls and help in achieving consistent compliance.

The second thing that i wanted to focus on was integrating existing systems with Cloud Services and these were the key points to focus on :

- **No Disruptions:**   
The transition must be well planned to avoid downtime or service interruptions. A phased approach, thorough testing, and robust rollback plans will be essential.

- **Improved Security Controls & Maintenance in Cloud:**   
 Cloud providers offer advanced security features, regular updates, and centralized management that can surpass what many on-premises setups can achieve, especially for maintaining the IAM solution itself.

- **Virtualization:**   
Virtualization can simplify the integration process by abstracting the underlying hardware and making systems more portable and manageable.

- **Centralization of Security for International Reach:**    
A centralized cloud IAM solution allows for consistent rules applied globally centralized, auditing and logging, Reduced attack surface complexity and most importantly they come with cloud applications and services, simplifying access policies, single sign-on (SSO), and multi-factor authentication (MFA) across the entire cloud solution

The Last Thing that i wanted to focus on was navigating Multi-Country Regulations (Governance and Compliance)

- **Each Country's Regulatory Data Standards:**   
This is the primary challenge. Regulations like GDPR (Europe), POPIA (South Africa), CCPA (California), and others have specific requirements for data residency, privacy, consent, and access.

- Non-compliance can lead to significant fines, reputational damage, and legal complications.

Once i had all the key aspects that i wanted to cover i then drafted the following email summary :

Good day, I have gone through the email and I have decided to lay out the following goals to ensure that the integration of TechCorp's IAM solution is seamless and fruitful:

Ensuring first and foremost that all the employees understand what is going to happen and ensure proper training to provide ease of use and also allow for easy onboarding and offboarding for any company size changes that may occur, as well as to have an industry standard they use, seeing the span over multiple countries.  

Integration of existing systems with cloud services, this is a crucial process. to ensure that the business flow has no disruptions and is very secure moving the systems to cloud services can lead to better security controls and maintenance. The use of virtualization makes it simpler to allow their current systems to be integrated into cloud systems. This puts TechCorp in a good position as the have international reach so accessing the systems from the cloud can allow centralization of security. Access control management will also be easier to implement with cloud service integration.  

Compliance and governance will be a bit tricky to handle as each country has its own regulatory data standards, which TechCorp will have to adhere to. This isn't much of a challenge as long as the manage to not infringe on any rules that they have set.

## Task Three

This part of the simulation was a build on to Task Two were i had to build an IAM solution specifically for TechCorp.

### Objective 

I was tasked to create detailed IAM solution designs in a PDF or Word document that directly address the two focus areas: enhancing user lifecycle management and strengthening access control mechanisms.

### Think process

From the response that i provided to the email i decided that a cloud solution like AWS would be the most ideal in getting an IAM solution for a company like TechCorp. The document below states the reasons why this would be the best, i have also provided images of the document :

## Task Four

This was the final task i had was to develop a comprehensive IAM platform implementation plan for TechCorp

### Objective 

I had to create a PowerPoint presentation that outlines the detailed implementation plan for TechCorp's IAM platform. This plan should provide a comprehensive roadmap for setting up the platform successfully.

### Think Process 

The first thing i decided to do was create a time-line, I decided that a period of three months would work best to accomplish this goal. These Three months would be divided into three main phases:
- implementation - This phase focuses on setting up and implementing the AWS platform to meet TechCorp's security and access management needs.
- Testing - This phase focuses on thoroughly testing the implemented IAM platform to ensure its functionality, security, and reliability.
- Training - This phase focuses on preparing TechCorp's teams for efficient use of the newly implemented IAM platform.
- an evaluation period were we would take note of any problems we may have missed and see if this was indeed the perfect solution for TechCorps needs.
  
 I decided that for the three main phases i had to account for the following key points :
 - Key deliveries - These were to be the take aways from the phase.
 - Objectives - This is what the phase had to accomplish.
 - Activities - The tasks that would be done to accomplish the objectives.
 - Challenges - Any problems that could occur doing the phase.
 - Success criteria - The baseline to determine if the phase was implemented correctly.

Once i had all this noted down i decided it was time to get into the first stage which was implementation, i will provide an image of the work that was done.

Then it was onto the testing phase

Then lastly it was the testing phase

The entire presentation will be attached below, but these were the key take aways from the task.

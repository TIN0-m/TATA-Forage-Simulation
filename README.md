# TATA-Forage-Simulation
In this simulation i was provided with four tasks. 
- The first task was mainly just a briefing on what IAM( Identity and Access Management- a framework of policies, processes, and technologies that enables organizations to manage digital identities and control user access to critical information and systems.) is, key concepts of IAM the role of IAM in cybersecurity and its importance in modern enterprises and a quiz.
- The Second task was the beginning of the Job simulation as i had to evaluate an enterprise's IAM strategy and considerations for implementing IAM in different organisational contexts. 
- The Third task was designing IAM solutions tailored to the enterprises' specific requirements
- The last task was to create a PowerPoint presentation that outlines the detailed implementation plan for enterprises IAM platform.

Before i get in to how i did this, id like to express that these resouces that you will get a glimpse of are provided by forage.
